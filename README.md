</p>

Simple console application created using Rust and [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) library.

## Overview
The application allows you to enter the net income earned in a given month, then calculates VAT and income tax -  <b>assuming that the form of taxation is a flat rate of 12%.</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Initially, it was supposed to be a console application that would allow to calculate taxes in my country - it turned out that the topic is disgustingly complicated - now I know what accountants are for lol.
<br/>
However it was fun to do it, [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) is a powerful library - definitely recommend if you want to do console apps.
